# Gym Bro

While working out, have you ever felt that your form had less structural integrity than a piece of wet toast? Well, worry no more for we have a solution, Gym Bro!

## What it does
Gym Bro is a workout coaching website that uses your webcam to analyze your workout form in real time.

## How we built it
**Tech Stack:**
- Python.
- OpenCV for webcam capture.
- MediaPipe pose landmarker for pose tracking.
- Python http.server for the local web server.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the browser UI.
- **ElevenLabs** text-to-speech for voice live coaching.

**Architecture:**
- Python manages the webcam and pose processing.
- Frames are analyzed locally.
- The annotated feed is streamed into the browser.
- A JSON endpoint exposes exercise state, rep counts, combo state, and feedback.
- The browser renders the live UI and handles optional voice playback.

**Main File:**
web_pose_server.py

## How to use it
